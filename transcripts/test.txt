Yeah, let's try that. I have some problems with my camera, so I can't join. You don't have to see me today. But I invited for this meeting, so great for all of us to join. We will see the results from this, the outcome where we will be. But from my perspective, me and Cheryl has been talking quite a lot on data in our meetings. We have regular meetings, me and Cheryl talking about automation and what is happening all over Skanje. And specifically, we are supporting M-A in the battery factory, their project where they're a bit backwards. They're working. They are to recruit, I think it's three automation engineers, so they don't know what they should do. So now we have a project to try to identify what they would work with. Yeah, a bit backwards. But then there is a lot of talk about data that they collect a lot later. And data is good, but we need to use data. And then the data becomes value for us. I think that's kind of the background. And then I know you, who stayed up for some time, has worked with this area. Maybe Mathias will pick over a bit. I don't know exactly. But how do we spread what you do in DE and other units all over Skanje, really, to try to make us use data as well? Yeah. That's kind of the background. I think, Shana, you can definitely go into more details. But what do you think from the lab perspective, what do you learn on this brief introduction? Yes, so there are, I think, a list of things you have touched upon. Let's take them one by one. First of all, there will be three automation engineers, or let's say, DEA, that they will be hired at ME, right, the battery factory. And in these three people, this competence about data will lie also within them. So that's also the idea that some of them will work with data, or we're trying to figure that out. I don't know if they know what they should do. But I know they have one guy now working with data at ME. But I think he's working most to S26. Yes, because, of course, you can subdivide a little bit the work in the area of data in different parts. One would be like the collection of data. So making sure that your equipment is generating data in a good format, in a good quality, and that provides the value, or in a way that you can later use it to create value, right? And that involves just building connections to the robots, maintaining these connections, troubleshooting stuff, maintaining databases, and stuff like that. Later on, once this data is available to be accessed, you will have usually this role of data engineer, so to say. It is a person that supports in moving the data between places and transforming the data. So what is happening is you have now a lot of data that is static, has been collected from the machines. And this person helps format the data in the way that later the consumers will use it. And then that brings us to the consuming side. On the consuming side, usually you start with analytics. That is maybe people that are just trying to understand things behind this data. And you can start by just understanding what are the diagnostics of your equipment. But you can also try to understand a little bit of your build dashboards, visualize information, and support the other teams. And the next step after that would be prescribing or predicting in the future. So you have some data sets and some information. And this has some type of patterns that we can analyze. And it tells us that if we continue like this, this machine will break down over time, for example. Right? So you have different areas or competences. And usually it's very difficult. So there are some people that are able to do all of these steps. But that is not so common. Usually you have people that are very good close to the hardware. There are people that are very good in all of this transformation of data, maintaining databases and making data available. And then there's people that are very good at the analytics part and potentially the next step to predicting that it's a machine learning. Okay. So that is a little bit of a summary of possible competences. Then you also mentioned that we need to understand what type of data or what we should use it for. And that maybe we're working backwards because we are hiring a person before we know what person is going to do. So there is two ways you can work with this, with data in general. One is like if we make like an analogy to the way we would cook. One is like we have a recipe and then we know what ingredients go in the recipe. We go into our fridge, we take out the ingredients and then we cook something. The alternative is we can go into our fridge directly. We open our fridge up. We see what's inside the fridge and based on the ingredients are there, then we build our dinner or lunch or something like that. So there is two ways, right? In this instance, it feels a little bit like we are looking directly into the fridge and seeing what's there
