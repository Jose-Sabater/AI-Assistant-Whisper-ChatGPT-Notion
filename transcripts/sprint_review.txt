 So welcome to the spring preview week 19. And let's start with what we have worked upon during this sprint. And to start with the industrial automation. What use cases we have worked. The OFMC now's POC 3. And simplify safety assessment for HRC. Continuous three one line revive a AL Union blog HRC, continuous three one line operator support. High regulation industrial camera. I'm a cell automated spring peaking universal applicable robot operation systems. Yeah, so these are the means. Use cases you're work upon and just I would like to add from my side where I have looked by the generation industrial camera so many was having a suggestion that how can we connect that camera and use those things with the Python SDK? So I reached to the level where we are able to capture the images through the software. So now camera is. The camera is confused for using taking the feature and now I will work on the Python SDK. So how through Python SDK we can capture the images and that that might go to that might go to the next. Anyone else who wants to share? Something on industrial automation or they have worked upon. We can say that PLC learning is complete. Yes, yes, you close. Yeah, yeah, acceptance from the. Or do they publish it? Don't stop. Yeah, it's a couple. It's not an average probably still Frederick to publish my compass. It will be the last question. Nice job. Very nice. Yes, also fairly he worked on this OPEX installations in the lab, so we made more to lay out how this robot that can be moved like a palette be placed and when we are having a meeting soon with Shunk to look at what group are to use. And also, yeah, we have to order some conveyor built so that we can replicate the production is. Order convert to the lab or. Yes. I see. But it's it's it's it's it's it's a bit upper debate at least a few meters and meet so that we can safety so we can't actually play something. How much we are or we wanted to have it in a way that we can close it and be nicely put away or that it for other problems. Yeah. What is that? Well, this more. No, no, please go ahead. It's interesting question. It's not. I'm not the nice person. I could be here. Yeah. And it's ultimately simply line D check integration faulted once again because this team leader quit. Yeah, the person that was overseeing it. So yeah, I in the next print, I will get back to that to see, OK, what is exactly the current stage? Where did the elephant get implementation? It's important reviving the. One has more to come down so that they are permanently in place and we have less deviation and then also for the cable management, this they should have arrived today. Actually somewhere is going. Yeah, it's not so it will look more leech and more safe. And then. And regarding this, continuous, you'll have a year if you have something for computer vision like because we were discussing and something is pending. We have booked amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then probably like because we were discussing with Mario like the next person are joining in June. And if they can also help just let me if you would like to discuss about that. Like we can plan for those resources also like if they can work on computer vision things for a well. You know, nice. No. So for operators for we had a lot of discussion on resources to come in and work with work instructions. So that would be doing some job in that area. And the DT are interested in having their product on the or in lab as a demonstrator. Yep. It's the. The person who is is on the study leave from MS and he's studying at the shopping and he will use some of them. It's going to be for us and hopefully this work. That's I can only think of this bear that those are just moving to the bear. See this. Every time you say that, I think bear. It's not that you will come. Also, you know, in June. OK, I mean, you mentioned all this TEDx talk. Yeah, that's great. Good job. A lot of things in the automation. I'm curious if you like, like if the way we are planning the things, what do you think that it's like when we can have this EAL and EAL of time training? We have a lot of activities for the next night and hopefully with this cabinet, it will look much neater. And yeah, we have already planned with the continuous driven line to have one HIV for the product for the next step. So we can just focus on getting it with the eight model. And I think that shouldn't take too long now that we have the rack bolted. Maybe we can put it up on the newsprint. No, I'm going to do that. Or. Three people. And then last week we have a new internship confirmed. Yeah, they have confirmed that they want to do it now. Now it's some administration that we as a company need to be approved by the Dutch government. So they are allowed to send the poor Dutch people to the lab. So there's some administration, but it should be nice. Shall I move to also mention some things RFID? Is that also industrial automation?
